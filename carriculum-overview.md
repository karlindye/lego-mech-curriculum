## 🧱 Books Used

- **Technic Idea Book: Simple Machines** — Weeks 1–6  
- **Technic Idea Book: Wheeled Wonders** — Weeks 7–11  
- **Power Functions Books (Vol 1–2)** — Weeks 12–17  
- **Fantastic Contraptions** — Used for enrichment and challenge builds

---

## 🧰 How to Use

- Navigate to `week-XX/lesson-YY.md` to access individual lesson plans.
- Use the `book_reference` field in each lesson for page numbers.
- Feel free to substitute, repeat, or simplify based on your child’s interest and attention.
