## 🧱 Activity

Use a crank to spin an axle. Explore how rotational force (torque) begins.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Learn about rotary input
- Discover circular vs linear motion

## 🗣️ Discussion Prompts
- Where have you seen this in real life?
- Why is a handle easier than turning an axle directly?

## 🧪 Challenge Extension
- Try using rubber bands or gears with the crank.
