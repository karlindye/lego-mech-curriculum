## 🧱 Activity

Create a LEGO device where a crank drives another mechanism (e.g. pump, lifter, spinner).

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Understand crank-driven machines
- Experiment with torque and speed

## 🗣️ Discussion Prompts

- What could this mechanism power?

## 🧪 Challenge Extension
- Build a crank that pulls something up or moves something forward.
