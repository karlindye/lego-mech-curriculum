## 🧱 Activity

Build a paddle that spins as you turn a crank. See how steady motion translates through a shaft.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Crank to axle transmission
- Smooth motion vs jerky input

## 🗣️ Discussion Prompts
- How could you use this for propulsion?
- What parts need reinforcement?

## 🧪 Challenge Extension
- Add a flywheel or try cranking with a rubber band.
