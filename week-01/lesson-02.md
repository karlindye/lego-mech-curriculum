parts:
  - 1x 7L or 9L beam
  - 1x axle (at least 5L)
  - 1x crank arm (or L-bent beam)
  - 2x connector pins
  - 1x axle connector or gear (optional)

## 🧱 Activity

Build a hand-powered crank. Attach a beam to an axle as a handle. When you rotate the handle, it should spin the axle and a top plate or beam.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Learn how cranks work (input rotation)
- See how **axles transfer motion**
- Understand how simple tools amplify motion

## 🗣️ Discussion Prompts
- How does this compare to turning a doorknob?
- What happens when you change the arm length?
- What else could we spin?

## 🧪 Challenge Extension
- Build a two-person hand crank and race to spin faster
- Add a propeller or windmill head to the crank

## 📸 Log
Film a video or take a photo of the spinner in motion.
