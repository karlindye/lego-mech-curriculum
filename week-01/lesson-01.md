## 🧱 Activity

Build a simple seesaw using two long beams. Use one beam horizontally and attach it to a shorter beam vertically as the pivot. Balance small LEGO bricks or figures on each side.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Introduce **leverage**
- Explore how length affects balance
- Practice aligning holes and pin connections

## 🗣️ Discussion Prompts
- What happens if one side is longer?
- What happens if one side is heavier?
- Why is the center important?

## 🧪 Challenge Extension
- Move the pivot point off-center
- Try a 3-armed seesaw using a T-connector
- Build a "weight guessing game" for balance

## 📸 Log
Take a photo and label each side with your child's name or characters.
