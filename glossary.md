## ðŸ”  Aâ€“Z Glossary

### **Actuator**
A mechanical device that moves or controls a system. In LEGO, linear actuators convert rotary motor movement into straight-line motion.

### **Axle**
A cross-shaped rod used to transmit rotation and support wheels/gears. Comes in various lengths and may have stops.

### **Axle Pin**
A hybrid part with one end as an axle and the other as a Technic pin. Allows transition between rotational and structural connection.

### **Beam (Liftarm)**
Technic part with round holes, used to build structure. Comes in straight, angled, and thin forms.

### **Bushing**
A small cylindrical part placed on axles to hold gears or wheels in place. Prevents side-to-side movement.

### **Crown Gear**
A gear with perpendicular teeth, often used to change rotational direction by 90 degrees.

### **Crank**
A beam or axle arm that rotates around a pivot to transfer motion. Often used in hand-cranked or motorized builds.

### **Differential**
A complex gear component that allows two wheels to spin at different speeds. Useful for vehicle turning.

### **Friction Pin**
Blue pin that connects Technic beams tightly. Adds structural strength and resists free rotation.

### **Frictionless Pin**
Tan pin that allows parts to spin freely. Best for moving joints and rotating parts.

### **Gear**
A toothed wheel that meshes with other gears to transmit torque and rotation. Sizes include 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 40 teeth.

### **Gear Ratio**
The relationship between two gears in a gear train. Determines mechanical advantage, speed, or torque.

### **Linear Actuator**
A Technic component that pushes or pulls in a straight line using rotational input. Used in lifting and pushing mechanisms.

### **Linkage**
A connected assembly of beams and axles that transfers motion through a path. Used in scissor lifts, arms, and leg mechanisms.

### **Motor (M/L/XL)**
Electric component that provides rotation. Larger motors offer more torque.

### **Panel**
Flat decorative or structural part used to cover large sections of a model or add styling.

### **Pin**
Small cylindrical part that connects beams by inserting into round holes. May be friction (blue) or frictionless (tan).

### **Pulley**
A wheel with a groove that guides string or band. Used to lift or transfer motion using tension.

### **Rack and Pinion**
A gear system where a round gear (pinion) rotates to move a straight gear (rack), typically for steering.

### **Remote Control**
A device that allows wireless control of motors and servos using infrared or Bluetooth.

### **Servo Motor**
A motor that can rotate to a specific angle, often used for steering or precise movement.

### **Shock Absorber**
A spring-loaded part that compresses under force. Used in vehicle suspension.

### **Steering Arm**
Technic element that connects wheels to steering mechanisms. Often used with rack-and-pinion systems.

### **Studless Design**
A Technic building style that avoids classic LEGO studs in favor of pin and axle connections.

### **Tire**
Rubber part that fits over Technic wheels. Provides grip and realism for vehicles.

### **Torque**
Rotational force. Important when using motorsâ€”more torque means more power to move heavy objects.

### **Track (Tread)**
Interlocking segments that form a continuous band for tanks or vehicles to travel on uneven surfaces.

### **Worm Gear**
A helical gear that rotates and drives a larger gear at a right angle. Provides high torque and slow motion.
