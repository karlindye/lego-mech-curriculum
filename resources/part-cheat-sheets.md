## 🧱 1. Beams (Liftarms)

| Name | Description | Common Lengths | Function |
|------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Straight Beam (Liftarm)** | Beam with round holes, no studs | 3L, 5L, 7L, 9L, 11L, 13L, 15L | Primary building block |
| **Bent Beam (Liftarm Angled)** | Angled in 90° or 135° | 3x5, 4x6, 5x7 | Used for triangles, supports, frames |
| **Thin Beam** | 1 module tall (vs normal 2) | 3L, 5L, 11L | Lightweight and used where height matters |
| **T-Beam** | T-shaped liftarm | T-shaped 3x3 | Useful for pivots and symmetry |

🔧 *Tips*: Count the holes to determine length. Odd-numbered lengths allow centering more easily.

## 📌 2. Pins and Axle Pins

| Name | Description | Color | Function |
|------|-------------|-------|----------|
| **Friction Pin (Blue)** | Connects beams, holds tight | Blue | Most common connector |
| **Frictionless Pin (Tan)** | Spins freely | Tan | Good for rotating joints |
| **Axle Pin (Gray)** | One side pin, one side axle | Gray | Great for connecting beams to axles |
| **Pin Joiner (Black)** | Connects 2 pins together | Black | Extends connection length |

🔧 *Tips*: Blue = friction, Tan = no friction. Friction pins are more stable for structures.

## 🔩 3. Axles

| Name | Description | Lengths | Function |
|------|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Axle** | Cross-shaped shaft | 2L to 12L+ | Transmits rotation |
| **Axle with Stop** | Has a flat end | 3L, 5L, etc. | Prevents sliding out |
| **Axle Connector** | Joins two axles | Gray or black | Increases axle length |

🔧 *Tips*: Look for small notches or stops. Axles wear more easily than pins—keep extras!

## ⚙️ 4. Gears

| Type | Description | Common Sizes | Use |
|------|-------------|--------------|-----|
| **Spur Gear** | Round with teeth | 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 40 tooth | Transfers motion, changes speed |
| **Double-Bevel Gear** | Works at angles | 12, 20, 28 | Used in gearboxes and tight spaces |
| **Worm Gear** | Screw-like gear | 1x4 shape | Converts rotation to linear motion |
| **Crown Gear** | Flat and wide | 24 tooth | Changes direction of motion 90° |

🔧 *Tips*: Use gear ratios (big/small) to change speed or torque.

## 🔗 5. Connectors

| Type | Description | Function |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Axle Joiners (straight, angled)** | Join axles at various angles | Build linkages |
| **Angle Connectors** | L or U shaped joints | Useful for custom geometry |
| **Cross Blocks (3-way, 4-way)** | Join 2+ beams at 90° angles | Structural support |
| **Rotational Couplers** | Allow rotation while connected | Good for moving arms or turrets |

---

## 🔄 6. Motion & Actuation Parts

| Type | Description | Function |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Linear Actuator** | Extends/shortens in a line | For lifting arms or platforms |
| **Shock Absorber** | Spring-loaded piece | Used in suspension systems |
| **Pulley Wheel** | Smooth wheel with groove | Use with string or rubber band |
| **Crank Handle** | 90° axle arm | Used in rotary builds |

---

## 🚗 7. Wheels & Treads

| Type | Description | Function |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Technic Wheel** | Wheel with pin/axle hub | For vehicles and carts |
| **Tires** | Rubber outer shell | Provides traction |
| **Tank Treads** | Snap-together tracks | Used in robots or terrain builds |
| **Differentials** | Gear inside a gear hub | Allows wheels to rotate at different speeds (advanced) |

---

## 🧰 8. Power & Electronics (3rd Party Compatible)

| Type | Description | Brand | Function |
|------|-------------|-------|----------|
| **Motors (M/L/XL)** | Different torque levels | Mould King / LEGO PF | Drives wheels or gears |
| **Servo Motor** | Rotates precisely by angle | Mould King / LEGO PF | Used for steering |
| **Battery Box (6.0V or IR)** | Powers motors | Mould King / LEGO PF | On/off or remote |
| **Remote Control** | Wireless command | Mould King / LEGO PF | For driving and controlling builds |

---

## 📎 9. Miscellaneous

| Type | Description | Use |
|------|-------------|-----|
| **Panels** | Flat curved pieces | Add body to cars or cover gears |
| **Frames (5x7, 7x11, etc.)** | Pre-formed rectangles | Rigid chassis or supports |
| **Bushings** | Stop axles from sliding | Look like little donuts |
| **Rubber Bands** | Add tension or return force | Used in catapults or linkages |

## 🧠 Part Identification Tips

- 🔢 **Count the holes** to determine beam/axle length
- 🎨 **Color coding** helps—most Technic colors are standardized
- 🛒 Use **BrickLink**, **BrickOwl**, or your part set images to match shapes/names
- 🧰 Sort by: beams, axles, pins, gears, motion parts
