## 🧱 Activity

Build a simple gear train using 3–4 gears. Rotate input and observe the result.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Understand compound gear trains
- Identify gear stages
- Observe cumulative effects on output

## 🗣️ Discussion Prompts
- What happens when we stack gears?
- How many spins does the output take?

## 🧪 Challenge Extension
- Build a multi-stage spinner with 4+ gears.
