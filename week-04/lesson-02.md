## 🧱 Activity

Build a small gearbox with multiple outputs. Observe which spins faster or slower.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Gear ratios in multi-stage systems
- Speed vs power tradeoffs

## 🗣️ Discussion Prompts
- Can we switch outputs easily?
- What if we added a motor?

## 🧪 Challenge Extension
- Make a hand-powered drill or winch.
