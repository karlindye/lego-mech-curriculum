## 🧱 Activity

Build a base where you can swap gears. Turn inputs and measure how long it takes for outputs to spin.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Identify gear ratios
- Learn speed vs torque tradeoffs

## 🗣️ Discussion Prompts
- What combos are fastest?
- What gives the most strength?

## 🧪 Challenge Extension
- Try vertical gearing or using belts.
