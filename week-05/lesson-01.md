## 🧱 Activity

Spin axles in frames with and without bushings. Compare smooth vs tight fits.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Axle rotation behavior
- Friction effects in builds

## 🗣️ Discussion Prompts
- Why is one axle harder to turn?
- What do bushings do?

## 🧪 Challenge Extension
- Build a simple spinner and time it.
