## 🧱 Activity

Build a stable rotating axle and compare spin times with different friction setups.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Test rotation under real conditions
- Learn about friction loss

## 🗣️ Discussion Prompts
- What makes it spin longest?
- How can you stabilize the axle?

## 🧪 Challenge Extension
- Add a gear or crank and see how it changes.
